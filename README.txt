The makefile is located within the src folder but might not work I could not test it because 
I do not own a linux computer. So I decided to compile my class manually.

To run the code if makefile does not work:
Go to src folder
compile wordApp.java using: javac WordApp.java
Then run it using: java wordApp <total words> <words on screen> <dictionary file>
